# The Wheel Knows

A simple web application that displays whether "The Wagon" is open or closed based on the status of a Govee smart plug.

## Overview

This project uses AWS services to create a serverless application that polls the Govee API to check the status of a smart plug, then displays whether the wagon is open or closed on a static website.

## Components

- **Frontend**: Static HTML/CSS/JS hosted on S3
- **Backend**: Lambda function polling the Govee API
- **API Gateway**: HTTP endpoint for checking status
- **Safety Function**: Prevents excessive costs by auto-disabling on high traffic

## Setup

See [setup.md](docs/setup.md) for detailed setup instructions.

## Architecture

See [architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for architectural details.
